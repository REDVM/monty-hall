# Monty Hall Simulation
Simulation of the [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) to have an intuition on it.

If you run it, you should get a result like : 
```
Probability to win in conserving the choice:  0.33385
Probability to win in changing the choice:  0.66458
```
Exactly what the theory says.
